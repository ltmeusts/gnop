# gnop
Guided Normal Orientation Propagation Across Sharp Features and Curved Regions for Point Clouds
By T. Li

Guided by two reference vectors stemming from an anchor point defined in the curved region, GNOP can propagate normal orientation easily across sharp features.   

### Compilation:
Windows: The code is tested by Visual Studio 2022 in release mode. The gnop.vcxproj is an example to configure the project.  
Third-party Libraries: Eigen

### Usage:
The project can run a testing example directly. You can run other examples by revising input/output file name and other parameters if needed.

#### Parameters:
input_name: name of input point cloud (.ply file), with or without normal.

output_name1: name of screened Poison surface (.ply file) generated by points with oriented normals

output_name2: name of output point cloud (.ply file) with oriented normals

k1, k2: neighbor size parameters used for initial un-oriented normal estimation in Sec.4.1 and orientation propagation in Sec.4.4, respectively. Please refer to Section 5.1 of the paper for detailed information.

t2: \tau_2 in the paper, used to determine the anchor point in Sec.4.3, which lives in [0.12, 0.20].


We can get ideal results using other parameters with the default values.
